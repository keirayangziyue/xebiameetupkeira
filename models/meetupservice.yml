    description: >
      This model contains information of the first and final RSVP response of each user for each event. 
      If a user has only one response to an event, the information of first and final response will be the same. 
      
      The combination of 'event_id' and 'rsvp_user_id' serves as the unique key for this model.
      The 'event_id' column uniquely identifies an event, while the 'group_id' column uniquely identifies a group,
      and the 'rsvp_user_id' column uniquely identifies a user.
